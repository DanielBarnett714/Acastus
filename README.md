Acastus is a completely private, free and open source Address / POI lookup application for android.

Use it to find nearby places, all without the privacy invasions and tracking features of other 
apps. 

Share your location to other people, knowing full well that the information is kept private.

Acastus relies on Pelias as the backend, a replacement for Google Maps and other geocoding services
that you can run on your own server. It uses the pelias-api to fetch results to your phone, allowing
you to search for places in Acastus. Then open and navigate to the result in your preferred 
navigation app, such as OsmAnd or Maps.me.
