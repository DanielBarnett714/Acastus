Summary:A free and open source address/POI search for navigation apps
Description:
A private, free and open source replacement for Google Maps and other geocoding services
that relies on Pelias, which you can run on your own server. It uses the pelias-api to fetch results to your phone, allowing
you to search for places in Acastus. Then open and navigate to the result in your preferred 
navigation app, such as OsmAnd or Maps.me.
