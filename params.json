It uses the pelias-api to fetch results to your phone, allowing\r\nyou to search for places in Acastus. Then open and navigate to the result in your preffered \r\nnavigation app, such as OsmAnd or Maps.me.\r\n\r\nDetails on setting up your own Pelias instance are here: https://github.com/pelias/pelias\r\n\r\nDonations are welcome and greatly appreciated:\r\n\r\n[Bitcoin](https://blockchain.info/address/1NjjuTxXm3ezpnVUGk4VmdEZUcym3SKZ8z)\r\n\r\n[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=VTUD5XRYMT686&lc=US&item_name=Acastus&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)\r\n",
